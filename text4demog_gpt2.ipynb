        "# Text4Demog Text Generation Using Transformers and GPT-2\n",
        "The `transformers` library, or [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/landing/inference-api/startups?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=Search&utm_campaign=Transformers+10x+Faster&utm_id=12055067954&gclid=CjwKCAjwzaSLBhBJEiwAJSRokg1r6FSo8X9OiDO2Gey41WMxEO8fNj8Odw2Twb9NmKBkrWFLnjAVtRoCGYEQAvD_BwE) is an easy to use deep learning library. It has tools for image and text data, and has many pre-trained models that you can download and fine-tune for your task. This short demo is based on work I did to produce a survey experiment that used computer-generated texts as treatments. It's designed to run in google colab, but you could run it fairly easily on any jupyter kernel with a gpu (and maybe less easily on a kernel with no gpu). "

This unit was the bldg owners apt for a long time and this is a rare opening. Well maintained beautiful 1926 building. Its the South West corner on the quiet North West side of Capitol Hill. It has south and west facing windows for excellent sunlight, and you're just blocks from Cap Hill's grocery store, Volunteer Park (the best park in the city) with a bus line right outside, and minutes from the light rail which can take you to the airport quickly. The available space is the master bedroom and the master living room, both with south facing windows for maximum light, and the space is bigger than any studio apt in the area, bigger than many one bedrooms, and for less than either, in most cases. The kitchen has a great West facing view of the Space Needle, Lake Union, Queen Anne, Puget Sound, and the Olympic mountains, giving you many beautiful sunsets. Since you have your own living room, and bedroom is just inside the front door, you dont pass through any shared space when you come and go, same with the bathroom which is next to your bedroom. I occupy the smaller bedroom and smaller living room and have been here for 3 years and Cap Hill for 10, originally from LA. Kitchen and Bathroom are shared and have good water pressure. Very friendly and willing to help those new to the city. I am a horticulturalist with many rare and endangered plants from around the world. Hoping to find someone that appreciates plants or at least doesnt mind them. I am a 40yo M, quiet, into art and science and music and movies and video games and the like. It really cant be overstated what a great location this is. Its as close to Amazon as you can get on the Hill, with a nice back route to South Lake Union, and you can walk to the water in 15 minutes. Bus can take you downtown in 15 minutes. There is a convenience store practically next door, as well as a quiet locals bar with food and a great view. As I paid security deposit and last months rent when I moved in, you pay only rent and the 250$ New Tenant Agreement. You wont be locked into a lease but I am looking for someone who wants to stay at least a year. Utilities and WiFi are already up and running, so you'll start paying 50% of Water and Electricity and Internet after a month. 40$ application is standard, with a fast turnaround time. There is an attached garage and parking is extra 150$ a month, which is less than many other places in the area. Come check out it out!\",\n",
