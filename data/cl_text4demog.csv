 Shown by appointment only.  Ready for move in on October 1, 2018 This house has been a great home for the last 15+ years.  Now you have the opportunity to enjoy this 2 bed/1 bath + loft home as your own.  I'm looking for the right person(s) to trust with the home that I've taken such great care of. I hope you will enjoy the hardwood flooring; it's ideal for pets or folks w/ allergies and is easy to clean.  The living room has high ceilings and plenty of space for a love seat and full size couch.  Curl up to the gas fireplace on those cold and rainy Seattle nights. The two bedrooms are roomy and have large closet spaces.  The loft area makes for a nice office space, media room or library.  It comes complete w/ an opening skylight for extra light and cool breezes in the warm summer. The large bathroom has been upgraded w/ a new shower surround, tall vanity and toilet. The spacious kitchen has tons of counter and cabinet space, updated glass front cabinets, a new dishwasher, deep sink and room for a table. The home also includes an efficient washer & dryer, refrigerator and new range/oven.  The heat is powered by energy saving forced air natural gas (furnace was recently inspected & cleaned).   The home is currently wired for an alarm system.  I've never used it but the new tenant can contact the provider and have it turned on. One of my favorite aspects of the home is the backyard deck w/ built in bench -- great for summer BBQ & entertaining your guests.  South side also has garden beds perfect for your green thumb (not required).  The back & north sides are fully fenced and gated -- great for people w/ pets. This home is great for people that want to live in a home that's close to all Seattle destinations! 29th Ave is a quiet tree lined street w/ plentiful parking.  Come and enjoy the easy location just 5 minutes to downtown, an easy commute to I-90 (3 mins to on-ramp). There are lots of parks w/in a 1/2 mile and if you love to bike, the I-90 bike tunnel is a few blocks away. This quirky, quiet street has a close tight knit group of neighbors that know one another & have a great community feel. Come and enjoy all that Lower Leschi has to offer. We are really nice, friendly people that are looking to rent our beautiful home to like-minded folks. Shoot me an email if you would like to see the place or if you have any questions. Qualification Requirements: * Absolutely no drugs * Absolutely no smoking (cigarettes, marijuana, other drugs or substances) * Income ratio 3:1 income to rent * Minimum credit score 700 * No evictions in the last 5 years * Minimum lease period 1 year Rental Details: -Utilities (Gas, Water, Sewer, Garbage & Electric) not included in rent -Rental history and credit check required - Fee paid by applicant -Renter's insurance required (about $10/month depending on your insurance agent - it's for your protection) -Renters responsible for lawn care & yard maintenance (cuts at minimum every 3 weeks) based on this rental price or we can work out a plan to have someone come for a lawn care fee -1st month, last month, $750.00 deposit required -Additional pet fee required (if applicable) -$150 non-refundable move out cleaning fee"

Here are just a few of the nice things they've had to say about my services: **I found Jonnathan through a Craigslist listing and he seemed like someone who could help me out. I emailed him with a list of specs I was looking for in an   apartment, what area I was looking at, and where I was commuting to and within an hour he was already sending me some places that I didn't see before (I already looked at all of the places on all other apartment hunting sites at least 10 times)! Jonnathan did all of the leg work and communication with the landlord. He was prompt to answer any question I had about the place and it is a place I really liked. I don't know where I would be right now if I hadn't contacted Jonnathan. I can't thank him enough for what he did for me, and the quickness he was able to find me a place. He was extremely professional, courteous, responsive, and dedicated to making sure I found the right place. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Jonnathan. Thank you again for finding me my apartment, it truly means the world to me! ** ** I found Jonathan on Craigslist. At first I was so incredibly skeptical about him being a real agent or not...THANKFULLY he is fully LEGITIMATE. So nice, so accommodating..he did everything for me. And he did it all fast!!! I was so impressed with him. I had very difficult specifications for my  apartment, and he literally found me the perfect place! I didn't have the time or the funds to come out before I moved so he went out of his way to ensure that my apartment would be ready for me to move in the day that I arrived! he is EXCELLENT! **"

 Hi! I am looking to transfer the lease on my apartment starting 01st Aug 2019 (negotiable) within a wonderful gated community in the highly desirable Rancho Cucamonga area. The Location- The community is great for families, single professionals and couples with easy access to shopping areas, malls and great restaurants within a few steps (literally). Route 66, I-10, I-15, parks, picnic areas and hiking trails are all close by and the Ontario International airport is a 7-10 minute drive. The apartment- 2 bedroom and 2 bathroom apartment (~1150 sq ft.) with an in- built washer and dryer and a large patio and ample storage space. The apartment is fully carpeted and has centralized air conditioning. Brand new additions include a security alarm system and a smart Nest thermostat control system. Each apartment comes with a designated enclosed parking garage. The community- Has two swimming pools, a fully equipped gym, pool table, lounge area, and a small movie theater for personal use. The catch- None. I'm looking for a clean transfer of the lease. The rent- Steal for the area, location and the amenities My offer- I have to unfortunately move out of town after having recently rented this apartment (everything is as good as new). I also have furniture that I am looking to offload for a reasonable price so you could end up getting a fully furnished/ semi-furnished apartment based on your needs (pics included). As a bonus, I will also chip in $250 of the rent for the first three months after you sign the lease. Important note: This is not a sub lease but a lease transfer. We will go through the process with the leasing office and a credit and background check will be required. Showing dates- I will be travelling for work and personal reasons over the next few weeks and for interested parties, the apartment will be available for viewing on the following dates: June 14th and June 15th - All day July 17th-21st- All day July 27th-July 31st- All day"

The available space is the master bedroom and the master living room, both with south facing windows for maximum light, and the space is bigger than any studio apt in the area, bigger than many one bedrooms, and for less than either, in most cases. The kitchen has a great West facing view of the Space Needle, Lake Union, Queen Anne, Puget Sound, and the Olympic mountains, giving you many beautiful sunsets. Since you have your own living room, and bedroom is just inside the front door, you dont pass through any shared space when you come and go, same with the bathroom which is next to your bedroom. I occupy the smaller bedroom and smaller living room and have been here for 3 years and Cap Hill for 10, originally from LA. Kitchen and Bathroom are shared and have good water pressure. Very friendly and willing to help those new to the city. I am a horticulturalist with many rare and endangered plants from around the world. Hoping to find someone that appreciates plants or at least doesnt mind them. I am a 40yo M, quiet, into art and science and music and movies and video games and the like. It really cant be overstated what a great location this is. Its as close to Amazon as you can get on the Hill, with a nice back route to South Lake Union, and you can walk to the water in 15 minutes. Bus can take you downtown in 15 minutes. There is a convenience store practically next door, as well as a quiet locals bar with food and a great view. As I paid security deposit and last months rent when I moved in, you pay only rent and the 250$ New Tenant Agreement. You wont be locked into a lease but I am looking for someone who wants to stay at least a year. Utilities and WiFi are already up and running, so you'll start paying 50% of Water and Electricity and Internet after a month. 40$ application is standard, with a fast turnaround time. There is an attached garage and parking is extra 150$ a month, which is less than many other places in the area. Come check out it out!"

63316793,"<lowt50> Private house wanted!!


The day after Thanksgiving 2019, my fianc was killed in a terrible car crash on his way to work. He was a wonderful provider for our family but unfortunately, I cannot afford to continue living in our home with our young daughter.
I am looking for a private house, 1-2 bedrooms/1 bathroom, that accepts big dogs (we got our daughter a German shepherd summer 2019 and it would break her heart to part with him). He is house trained, good with children, and continuing obedient school.
Willing to introduce our dog if needed.
I have just returned home in January from a medical treatment center and have been looking for more work but at the moment, I can afford $1,200 with most utilities included.
I have good credit and a reliable source of income.
Also, looking for potential mother/daughter house; 2-3 bedrooms/1-2 bathrooms. My oldest daughter offered to move in with me to help with expenses. She has excellent credit, steady income and we are both very clean tenants. $2,200 with utilities included."

I've lived in 2 different apartments on this block since 2004--Fort Greene is amazing! (both the original """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""She's Gotta Have It"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" film and the recent Netflix series were filmed on my block, to give you an idea of the mix/vibe). Has adapted VERY well and safely to COVID-19 quarantine and reopening.
GETTING AROUND:
- 5 Citibike kiosks within 3blks
- 7min walk to G @ Fulton or C @ Lafayette
- 12min walk or 5min bus to B/M/Q/R @ DeKalb (2 stops to Union Square)
- 15min walk or 5min bus to 2/3/4/5 @ Nevins
- 15min walk or bus to A/C/E @ Jay St
REALLY IMPORTANT NOTE:
I've had this apartment since 2004! I want to keep my options open, so I WILL be keeping the 3rd (smallest) bdrm in this apt for storage. I'm looking for someone who doesn't mind if I come by 1-4x per month by appointment, so that I can keep some of my houseplants here, and move things out of storage slowly. I will only enter the premises with your permission, at least 24hrs notice, and at whatever day/time is most convenient/feels safest to you. If you prefer not to cross paths, we could schedule my visits while you're at work, or while you're grocery shopping--I have a 100% flexible schedule. What do you think? I'm a friendly, organized lady--very googleable so you can confirm that I'm reliable and kind. For the right person, I'd be willing to leave access to all kinds of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""deluxuries"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" like a water rowing machine, antique furnishings, custom-built/fit shelving, etc."

This is an unusual housing set-up.  This is a separate house, with no shared walls, however there is a duplex and studio on the same property, so the yard and laundry area are shared.

Our aim is to continue to foster a sense of community where each household on the property gets along with each other and contributes to the common good. It is a diverse micro-community, including 4 children under the age of 10 and all share the common spaces. Each household helps keep the common spaces clean and inviting. Owner is a handyman, so any maintenance needs are addressed immediately, and since the owners lived here we try to keep it as nice as if... well, as if we lived here!
The city has rent control, which means your rent can never go up by more than inflation!
Shared laundry machines, small yard, roof deck, and a garden box for you to plant whatever you would like. The property is enclosed with a locked gate.  Storage shed and up to two gated off-street parking spaces (one with EV charging) available for additional cost - $25/mo for shed, $75 for each parking space.

With its prism-like faade this new 24-story glass apartment tower reflects the increasing trend of luxury high-rise living in the South Loop. Located in the McCormick Square micro-neighborhood, renters of the 275 units here are near the sprawling McCormick Place Convention Center, Illinois Institute of Technology, and DePaul Universitys Wintrust Arena.

Culture and recreation are also nearby at the Museum Campus, Soldier Field, Northerly Island and the Lakefront Trail.
Live a lush life for less with amenities that rival other downtown high-end apartments, but at a more attainable price point compared to other Loop-adjacent neighborhoods such as West Loop, River North and Streeterville.

Elements of on-trend exposed concrete ceilings and wide plank wood flooring also create a modern loft look. The floor-to-ceiling windows provide brilliant unobstructed views in all directions.

My name is jill and I am looking for a reasonable rent that I can afford. I moved here from florida to help my kids with my grandchildren. I have 3 grandsons, one them i care for 3 days a weeks, 10 hrs a day. I really don't want him in daycare yet as he is only 10mnths old and this virus does not discriminate.
I've been looking for a reasonable rent as it is quite a bit more expensive up here than it is in florida. I want to stay, and help and the only way I can do this is if I find a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment  for about $1,100- $1,200. It's hard to find.
I am a great tenant, always pay rent on time, I'm clean, and a good person. I'm hoping there's someone out there who is willing to help me out. I'm  really hopeful that I can stay in NY to help my kids. Thanks, Jill c. Resnisky.   Ps....I have a small dog, 10lb, coby."

33556428,"<lowt50> $1750 - 2 BR Open Concept home w/ hot tub, gardens- Avail Feb 1st!

 **Prefer 1-year lease; open to month-to-month.** Available 1 February 2019 on beautiful Vashon Island... (5 miles from the north-end ferry dock to Fauntleroy/West Seattle). Finish out winter and get ready for Springtime, when everything starts to bloom! in your island rental, with a soak in the hot tub underneath the evening stars (made more bright without city noise from street lights and sounds)... perhaps hearing horse hoofs in the distance (property borders 10 acres of horse pasture)... enjoying the quiet of rural life with all the conveniences and amenities of city life, just a 5-minute drive or 20-minute leisurely walk to the town of Vashon with bus stops and park and rides.  Close to schools and all amenities. This 840 sqft (but feels bigger due to the high ceilings and open floor plan) house, is one of two small houses on a 1/3 of an acre, bordering horse pasture.  The owner (that would be me!) resides in the small cabin (40 feet from main house, separated by bamboo fencing) on the property and is away 11 months of the year.  During her time away, a lovely tenant with her little dog lives in the 400 sqft cabin behind the main house.  (Years ago, the cabin used to be run as MiKo's Guest House, thus the name depicted in the photo.) Unique, colorful, open concept rental with two dedicated bedrooms (2nd smaller room is perfect for an office). Ideal for 1 person or a couple (due to grandfathered small septic system, no more than 2 people).  Olympic Prodigy Hot Tub on deck, with front and back lawns, vegetable raised bed (or planters on the back patio) and perennial gardens.  Ideal for the garden enthusiast who loves to garden organically or just wants a home-base for your creative endeavors. This is a special place: quaint, with lots of light, privacy, apple tree, strawberries, raspberries, cranapples, vegetable gardens in raised beds (all organic), maintained yard, surrounded by tall trees providing privacy from neighbors and a bamboo fence separating the nearby cabin (with renter). A small backyard fence is ready for your well-behaved dog. I'm looking for a person or couple who wants *a sense of community* while appreciating the *privacy of each other's space*, realizing that there several *shared spaces* on the 1/3 of acre of property: 1) hot tub and deck area, 2) left shed (gardening, lawnmower and other supplies), 3) shared use of turnaround parking in front, 4) garbage/recyclable containers in back and 5) access to the plentiful fruit in season from the main trees and bushes.  Due to the Grandfather septic system, with one person living in the cabin, there is a 2-person limit for the main house. This is an island after all, and we are interdependent upon one another.  Being respectful of the common areas makes for an enjoyable living arrangement for everyone residing on the property. I've owned the property since 2006 and love the space that I have created:  inviting, creative, aesthetic, and tidy.  I'm looking for someone who appreciate those values in their living arrangements. Each building has a separate PSE meter, so you're responsible for your own usage.  The water bill--approximately $80 every 2 months--is shared 2/3 for this house.  1/3 of the bill is paid by the occupant of the cabin. Rent $1750 plus water (Water District #19) and electricity (PSE).  (water = ~$80 every two months;  PSE, depending on use, winter can be as high as $175 and summer as low as $65) and your own Comcast cable. You're responsible for garbage (weekly road service pick-up or your own trips to the county dump) and recycling (free on island).  Organic composting (worm bins) available.  Lawn care and quarterly drain/re-fill of the hot tub provided by a handyman/property manager and gardener. Note: There are 2 full-size closets (living room and 2nd bedroom) and one walk-in closest in the master bedroom.  And there's a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""loft-like"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" area in the 2nd bedroom for storage.  Sorry, there is no extra storage available on the property for tenants' use.  The left shed is shared access by all tenants, handyman and gardener for gardening and yard tools, etc... with the right shed reserved for owner's private use.  If you require additional storage, there is secure island storage unit in town, next to the Vashon Post office. This is ideal for someone who is interested in living independently while sharing harmonious proximity to a person 40 feet away, AND 1) is wanting a home base while their ideal island home is being built OR 2) is an islander wanting a quiet oasis, close to town OR 3) someone wanting to try out island living, with all the joys, and yes, sometimes challenges, that comes with a small community of 11,000 and a ferry system that is a joy when it works and pain-in-the-butt when it on a 2-boat schedule! If you have the flexibility to commute from home--like thousands of islanders do--seek a community to sink your teeth into, wish to enjoy the arts, music, live performances, organic foods/farm stands, great, cozy coffee houses and bookstores, a fantastic library (we're part of King County), and enough trails to walk to feel like you're in the middle of nowhere, with beaches to stroll along to enjoy the sunrise on one side of the island and sunset on the other, and the friendliest people you'll ever want to meet, then island living is for you! Additional information: 1.** No smoking or vaping, either inside or anywhere on premises** 2.  Some furnishings that can stay or be removed, for example: butcher block island with shelves on wheels in kitchen 3.  Overview of details: * Open concept 840 sq feet home with cathedral ceilings and 3 skylights. Open and airy feel! * Master bedroom with walk-in closet * 2nd bedroom (or office space) * Full bath, with skylight and adjustable hand-held shower head with various water pressure settings * Large open space/living room/dining room area, with high ceilings and skylights * Ceiling fan * Full kitchen * Dishwasher * New black fridge and stove (both 2015) * Stackable washer/dryer (new dryer 2016) * Built-in microwave * Private concrete porch/sitting area in the backyard * Wired for Comcast cable for hi-speed Internet access and TV. Just bring (or rent) your own Cable box from Comcast and turn on the service. Additionally: * Located on Beall Road, a 20-minute leisurely walk to Vashon town, and a short drive to KVI beach! * Borders 10 acres of horse pasture, with fence along three sides (access to Beall Road unrestricted) * Well-behaved dog negotiable (metal fence installed in backyard for peace of mind) with an additional pet deposit * Easy to maintain organic, raised vegetable beds * Shared parking on site: turnaround area and parking up front for tenant and guests; tenant in back parks next to cabin but needs turnaround area up front for self and guests * Furnished cabin 40-feet behind the privacy fence, where 1 tenant lives 11 months of year and owner returns the remaining ~3-4 weeks. LEASE TERMS: -No smoking policy -Preferrable:  one-year's lease - 1 month's rent ($1750) + 1 month's security deposit of $1750 at time of signing the lease -$395 nonreturnable cleaning fee (carpets cleaned after each tenant) -$45.00 fee for full credit/background check approval with Landlord Protection Services LPS (tenant's pays) -One well-behaved dog or one indoor/outdoor cat with additional $500 refundable pet fee will be considered, on a pet-by-pet basis.

 UPDATED 5/23/2020: If you previously contacted me about this apartment and are still interested after reading this update, please reach out again now that I have new info from the building owner. Thank you. I'm giving up my 2-bedroom apartment -- fully furnished -- and moving out of state. You can take over the apartment as early as Saturday, June 13. By taking this place, you can keep all the furnishings, including 3 energy-efficient in-window AC's -- one is brand new, the others are 3 and 4 years old. The landlord says that the new tenant will take the apartment """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""as is"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and will start a new 1-year lease effective July 1 with the same rent rate I'm paying -- no increase ($1918.80). If you want to move in mid-June, you would pay me a prorated rent for June depending on when you move in, and begin paying the landlord as of July 1. The landlord requests that your household income be close to or above 40x the rent, so a household income of around $75,000+ is what they'll be looking for, with some flexibility. They will also require a security deposit (mine was one month's rent). Quiet building in Inwood, 2 blocks to both the A and 1 trains. Blocks away from 3 beautiful parks, 3 grocery stores within 3 blocks. There is laundry in the building and a laundromat across the street. The apartment is on the 3rd floor (up two flights of stairs, 34 steps total). There is no elevator in the building. An exterminator comes once each month on the 4th Tuesday of the month, and the apartment remains bug-free. The super lives in another building around the block and is onsite regularly. He is very responsive by text, and usually sends someone to take care of my issue within 1-3 hours. The apartment as been well-maintained since I moved here in 2016. Large kitchen has a dishwasher, gas stove, microwave, refrigerator/freezer with ice maker. My dishes, pots and pans, silverware, etc can remain. 2 bedrooms: master bedroom has brand new queen pillowtop mattress (4 months old), 2 nightstands, 2 standing Ikea wardrobes, large dresser, and a large walk-in closet. 2nd bedroom has full-size bed, dresser, nightstand with phone charging ports, and closet. Living room has small sofa, 2 chairs, coffee table, a chest with drawers for storage, and a bookshelf. I will also leave behind my 40"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" LED TV."

35498113,"<lowt50> Looking for someone to take over lease of two-bedroom apartment

 Hello, our rent is currently $900 a month plus a flat Water fee of $50.25. They are both payable on the 1st of every month. The lease ends July 31st 2019. The management requires a 30 day notice if you are not going to renew the lease. This is a straight lease transfer and not a sublet. You would be required to fill out an application at the property management office. Also, you would need to have the electric placed in your name. The security and pet deposit fee for one animal has already been paid and would be transferred to the new tenants. The apartment is on the third floor and faces the sun all winter long. We very rarely use the Heat.  The apartment is located in the last building before the cul-de-sac and faces the parking lot. The washer and dryer is located in the lower level of the building. The apartment complex also has two swimming pools. We will be moving out Monday February 25th 2019. The apartment would be ready to move into on March 1st 2019. The application fee is $50 per adult and is to be submitted to the property managers at Berkshire Apartments. That would be the only out-of-pocket expense other than the current month's rent and Water fee. The security deposit fee of $99 and the dog fee of $400 would be transferred to the new tenants. The two-bedroom apartments allow up to five people and two pets. Our two bedroom apartment has a very large master bedroom, walk-in closet, living room and balcony. The bathroom has a shower that is fully tiled to the ceiling. It also has a very long counter with lots of cabinets and drawers. The walk-in closet has a sink, vanity, long counter and mirror.

If it's an owner, ask for a Full Name along with some kind of proof of ownership
Don't be the next Craiglist rental scam victim! A client of mine had the intuition to reach out to verify the details of a 'rental listing' by an
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""absentee owner.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
We quickly confirmed it was an attempted
SCAM
. I subsequently helped her find a great rental using an official CA Real Estate Rental Contract. Since then, I have been posting on Craigslist to help safeguard both Renters & Owners in our community.

33156085,"<lowt50> Vashon~Lg 2 Bdrm~Mountain Water View~Partially Furnished~Easy Living

 Live in Comfort, Ease and Beauty! Thats what I set out for when I built my home nearly 10 years ago! I am offering the top floor (1250 square feet including deck) of a 2 story home that was built with a complete self sufficient apartment downstairs. About the space~ There are 2 large bedrooms. The master Bdrm has french doors that open onto the deck with a view of Mount Rainier and Puget Sound, S.Seattle & Tacoma's sky-lines! In the early morning, when you open your sleepy eyes to a glowing pink and orange sunrise over Puget Sound & Mount Rainier you will feel like you are in Heaven on Earth. Then step out onto the maplewood floors throughout and be all cozy and warm from the in-floor radiant heat as you make your way into the large kitchen for your coffee. Set your cup on the Granite counter. Turn on the 5 burner gas stove as you prepare breakfast and plan to sit on your stool at the long Granite counter and watch the ships and boats meander down the blue Puget Sound with the magnificent Mount Rainier across the water. Then maybe its time for a bath in the extra-long, deep tub or a shower in the open shower all tiled in beautiful Marble across from the double Glass sinks. If its a hot day you'll open the French doors entry way and the double paned windows (which there are many of) and feel the sweet breeze wafting through the space all day keeping you cool.

34289399,"<mediumt50> Room for rent in two bedroom apartment

 My roommate is moving to the west coast mid-late January therefore we are looking to fill the room. Room is very big with two closets and plenty of space for a king bed and extra furniture. The lease is up at the end of June so it's ideally for someone looking a short-term rental but there's the option of extending. Apartment is a new building and we were the first people to live here. It comes with washer/dryer, dish washer, central air/heat, rooftop. There is one shared bathroom. We are one block from central park so it is great if you like running or have a dog that needs walking. Public transport is great - two block walk from 110th 6 train stop or a 5 minute walk to the 110th 2/3 so well connected to east and west of Manhattan. Rent is $1,600 each and you'd get the bigger room. Bills tend to come to around $100-150 each month includes cable/wifi/con-ed but looking to change the cable package so that should come down a bit. I am a 30 years old and Irish working in finance. I lay low during the week and keep it quiet as work can be busy and will usually be out and about at the weekend. I enjoy music, running, sport etc."

33707462,"<mediumt50> Lovely 2Bd/1BA Apt Home 2 Blocks to Green Lake

 Looking for a second pea to join my 2-bedroom pod right next to Green Lake! A little about me: I'm in my mid twenties working as a financial analyst for one of the big companies in Seattle, and I'm looking to find another awesome roomie! I work long hours, so I love coming home to my quiet, cozy apartment in the heart of GL. In my spare time, I like to walk around the lake, go paddle boarding, and pretend that dark chocolate is a healthy snack. A little about the apartment: This is a 2 bed/ 1 bath, 750 sqft apartment on a beautiful neighborhood street next to green lake. The apartment is a 2 block walk to the lake where there are limebikes, a park with baseball, volleyball, and basketball areas, and summer concerts. 2 grocery stores are located within 4 blocks, as well as coffee shops, restaurants, shops, etc. The rent (plus all utilities and internet) is approx. $1100 per month. Street parking is available, and while the assigned garage is full at the moment, I'm on the waitlist for a 2nd spot (for you!) when one opens up. No pets. Stainless steel appliances, full W/D in unit. The living room has decor and furnishings. A little about you: The most important thing is that you're an honest, kind, and respectful person. I'm hoping to find someone who is up for more than just being a hermit in her room, and jives well with my lifestyle in this space! If you live for Sunday brunches, cry when you watch This is Us, or eat Brie like nobody's business - that's a bonus! If any of this sounds good to you, reach out and tell me a little bit about yourself- What do you do and where do you come from? What are you looking for in a living situation? What are your best AND worst habits as a roommate? What do you do in your free time?"

73459371,"<mediumt50> 1400 Sq ft luxury 2 Bed 2 Bath


Large 2-bedroom condo available for rent in a luxury building with 24-hour concierge, gym (temporarily closed due to COVID-19), courtyard with BBQ, and private shuttle to the Hoboken PATH station (temporarily not running due to COVID-19).
We lived here happily for many years, but unfortunately work out on Long Island forced us to move away. We hope that you enjoy living here as much as we did.   Available for showings, will be vacant January 1st 2021.  No rental fee.
The unit is 1400 square feet. It has an open-concept kitchen and an in-unit washer and dryer. The kitchen comes with a BRAND NEW stainless steel refrigerator, stove, and microwave. The living room already has a flat-screen mounting in place for your TV. The master bedroom has a spacious en-suite bathroom with separate shower and bathtub, and his-and-her sinks. Also included in the rent are heat, gas, water, cable TV, and high-speed internet and WiFi. The unit can partially furnished for free if you're interested. If you need parking, we can provide parking for an additional fee.
The gym is right down the hall. There's a nice view of the courtyard as you run on the treadmill or use the elliptical. The gym also has a full weightlifting set up with barbells and dumbbells. The courtyard has charcoal grills and a picnic table, which are great for summer BBQs. There's a recreation room with a flatscreen TV and a pool table. We've used it for hosting parties when we wanted to accommodate a large crowd. The recreation room is temporarily closed due to COVID-19, but all of the amenities will be available once the pandemic is under control.
Shopping is really easy from our place. A supermarket is one block away (so convenient when you need to run out for some milk in the morning), Target and Best Buy is two blocks away.
The building is a 1/2 mile away from Hoboken's bustling Washington St, where you can find restaurants, bars, and cafes. The Hoboken waterfront and its parks are nearby, perfect for strolls, running, or lying around and enjoying the warm sun. Not to mention, the Newport's shopping centers are a few blocks away. So you have your choice in terms of where to go for dining, drinking, and shopping when the pandemic is over.
The surrounding area is undergoing rapid change. Several new buildings have been built or are being built. A new park, a couple of blocks away, will be opening up in a few months. This is a great place to be. It's quiet enough to enjoy a peaceful night at home, but you can easily walk to places for entertainment when night life is available again when the pandemic is over."

73560560,"<mediumt50> Solar Home in Manayunk, 2 Car Parking, Back Yard and Garden/Orchard


I love this house! My family of three is in need of more indoor space, but this house is well-loved and we will truly miss it. Move-in date is Feb 1. I may be able to push it to Jan 15th if you need.
Things I love about this house:
It runs on solar. Everything is electric and energy bills are about $8-50 per month, depending on your use. Super cheap and you get to give back to the grid!
Large back yard!I planted a really fun garden: 1 red haven peach tree, 2 santa rosa plums, and my favorites, THREE montmorency sour cherries (one dwarf), which produce the most delicious cherries. One York cherry which produced six cherries last year and on its way to making more, strawberries, double bearing raspberries, and various otherthings. Garlic chives, sunchokes. Cornelian cherry tree. The peaches are mostly squirrel treats and the plums are still babies, but I've beentaking good care of everyone and they might produce for you. Cherries, strawberries and raspberries all produce a lot. Raised bed in the back, treated with food-safe stain. You would be in charge of mowing the lawn.
Driveway parking: it can hold two cars, three if one is super small. Such a huge perk in Manayunk!
Walkability: various septa bus stops (27, 32, 9) and the Manayunk-Norristown train are right nearby. Main St. is right down the hill, with restaurants and shops. Ridge Ave is up and coming, also close. Ten minute walk to Acme and Rite Aid.
Bike-ability: The canal towpath is right down the hill. Wissahickon park is 5 mins away. Hills are great for exercise! Center City is a 7 mile ride.The Rec: great for soccer, baseball and other field activities.
Balcony with beautiful view. You can see the city! Church bells ring in the distance on the hour during the day starting at 8am. Not really noticable unless you're listening for them, but it's nice and feels European.
New, energy efficient, front-loading washer and dryer on second floor
Central AC
Brand new heating system, just installed.
The most gorgeous, cedar shed you ever did lay your eyes upon.
Back deck for eating and grilling
Mid-day, direct sun in the second floor, front bedroom
A view of trees and the garden in the back bedroom.
1.5 bathrooms
Dishwasher and garbage disposal.
RE Covid: I'm including photos galore with the hopes that you get a good sense of the place and only inquire if you are serious. Photos are from various times and in various stages of furnishment.  If you decide you are serious, we can schedule a masked walkthrough that lasts under ten mins. I also have some videos I can send you, just ask.
First month and deposit to hold it for you. If this ad is still on Craigslist, it is still available. I'm asking $1700. Please tell me a little about yourself(selves) including your level of psyched-ness about inheriting a garden. Extra points if you write about how you think compost could save the world. LGBTQ and POC welcome and encouraged. Happy to answer any questions."
